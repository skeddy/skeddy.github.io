# Hello!

Welcome to my slightly often but not little space on the web!

I'm a techincal analyst by day, gamer/tech support at night (and sometimes during the day).

With nearly 20 years of helping others with techincal issues with their home computers, I've become rather good at spotting issues, and getting them solved.

And not just home computers - Android based phones too!

## What is this?

This is where I've decided to start documenting little support issues I've worked on for friends/family. It was fueled by the fact that since the late end of 2021, I had five laptops passed over to me for performance issues. The first, well it took a while, but I got that back to optimal performance. The second, a few more things to tidy and tweak, but same result.

By the third and onwards, I had a good little check list of things to start with, and it made it a lot easier to run them off in bulk at the start.

So this *thing* exists for my own notes, and to give you the ability to do some DIY fixes yourself on your home computer and maybe your Android phone.

## What is this not?

Apple/iOS support... sorry!
