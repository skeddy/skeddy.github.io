## Hello!

Most people at 40 either get a motorbike, or a boat, or a fast car, maybe a mistress (or two) or something of expensive value that they will wear till the day they die.

For my 40th, I had a crazy idea...... myself, and my friends are giving others a gift.

The gift of help.

The gift of understanding.

The gift of conversation.

This crazy idea of mine will give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside...... and will probably give me pain and a few good battle scars too.

I'm teaming up with [The Samaritans](https://www.samaritans.org) and [Cruse](https://www.cruse.org.uk) to take on a challenge for 2020 -  celebrate turning 40 in style and also in the memory of my Brother Chris.

I had to do something for each of the 40 years I'll have been on third rock from the sun.

So I'm going to be taking part in various events over the year, to run a total of 60km (37.28 miles according to Google). (40 years on the planet, plus an extra 20 just for giggles)

**You:** Whaaaaaat?!

**Me:** Yes

**You:** Idiot

Yep, that's the plan. To date, I have **50.5km** booked - so I'm committed.

**UPDATE** - All events are now listed on the [events page](/events.html)

60km will be done and it will take my legs to the limit and take my body to hell and back - I'll run/walk/crawl/slide to hit that magical 60km mark.

So why do I need your fuzzy feelings? Well, quite simply, the Samaritans and Cruse are two absolutely fantastic organisations. Both have very personal connections to myself and the family, and I wanted to help fund raise for them in 2020.

If you feel like dropping them a few quid, to help spur on my crazy 60km challenge, then you can do so via one (or both) of the following links. If you just want to throw me some cash as well, I'll gladly donate on your behalf.

I just want to finish by saying that anything you can give, will be very well received, even if it's a motivational kick up the backside to keep me going - It'll still mean the world to me.

So thank you - thank you - thank you!
