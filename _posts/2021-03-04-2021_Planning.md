title: "2021 Planning"
---

Well I think I covered it off nicely when I mentioned how Covid has [messed up my plans](https://skeddy.github.io/2020/11/08/Looking_To_2021.html) for the challenge.

But I'm not one to take it laying down.

A number of events that I was going to do in 2020 have now started to gear up for 2021, and have even planned and moved during their original plans.

I even got around to signing up for an event that I wouldn't have been able to do in 2020 because of a date clash.

Oh, and I sent a new 5km PB recently too!

Anyway, this is just a little update to let you know that I'm still going for this challenge. I've even upped the distance to 150km because.... I'm stupid.

Full evnet listing here:

If you have any events that you think I should be doing to cover off the other 70km, drop me a line on the social channels below!

Much love, stay safe, get a jab,
