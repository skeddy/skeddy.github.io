Wow so yeah... 2020 then...

Covid-19 firmly decided to put a dent in my plans for events and the 100km I wanted to run.

With 35km done and on the tally, other events were (rightly) closed for the rest of the year, dates being shifted to 2021 where possible.

But this does mean that I now have 2021 to fullfil my commitment to <a href="samaritans.html" target="_self">The Samaritans</a> and <a href="cruse.html" target="_self">Cruse</a>. And seeing as things didn't pan out correctly, I'm thinking it time to go bigger and better....

150km for the total ?

Why not...

Keep watching, keep safe, keep healthy, and in case you missed them...
