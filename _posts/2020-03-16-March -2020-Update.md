Wow, so best laid plans etc....

At the moment, with the Coronavirus doing it's thing, races etc for this year are still on. But hat could change within the next few weeks or days.

I'll keep an eye out on the events and update and re-plan as required. 

It's absolutely not worth the risk for any of the other competitors, marshalls and other staff to put themselves at risk.

Take care, speak soon!
