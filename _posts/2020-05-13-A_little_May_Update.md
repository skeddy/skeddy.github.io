title: "A little May Update"
---

Well the KM's are being ticked off, all within the rules of the current lockdown that's in place. 

April saw me complete:

* [Running GP Goodwood](https://skeddy.github.io/2020/04/25/Goodwood_done.html)

* [Mini Gauntlet Challenge](https://skeddy.github.io/2020/05/13/The_Mini_Infinity_Gauntlet_20km.html)

I'm feeling great after both of these, and alraedy have another medal lined up for May to complete.

Events are still being shaken about, and yesterday I agreed with my team mates to defer the Nuclear Rush 7km from October to May next year. 

Have been looking forward to running that particular OCR for the year, but wasn't that keen on runing it in October. Due to other things we all decided to defer to May - when it's warm and we know we can enjoy it, so watch this space.

I've also lined up another 10km for later in the year, and I've been thinking about extending the distance of the challenge to 150km because.....well, I have more time now!

So again, watch this space - stay home, stay safe.
