##  If you've found this... you got a problem

In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit.  

In 1980, the guy writing this was spat out onto this world.  

The men from 1972 promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.  

Me? I just grew up, took things in, got inquisitive and grew into a person that liked to prod and poke technology to see if it worked.  

Eventually, I wound up in a job that helped me with my professional career, while benefiting my personal interests.  

Today, still wanted by the government the guys from 1972 survive as soldiers of fortune.  

But... If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find me....maybe I'll get your PC issue sorted so you don't have to call these old guys from '72 or worse.... argue with some turd at Currys/PC World.  

## What's here?

I'll break this page into three parts:  

* Fast Fix Scenarios (FFS)  
* If I've helped... 
* Deeper background into the FFS above...

## If I've helped...

I'll honestly let you know if my time has been more hands on than hands off, and not take the proverbial for any payment.
