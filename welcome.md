# A warm welcome to your PTFA

We know you already have a lot to do when you join our school community but we wanted to introduce ourselves and give you some key information about the PTFA (that’s 
Parent Teacher Friends Association), how you can help us, and what’s in it for you.

## Who are we?

Our group is called St Catherines Catholic Primary School Parent Teacher Freinds Association and has been running for over xxxx years.

We’re a lively group of volunteers and our main function is to support the school by raising as much money as we can to enhance, enrich and improve learning experiences for the children.

We also exist to bring the communities of school and home closer together because it makes sense for parents and friends to be involved in the life of their chosen school.

Lastly, we’re here for the simple reason that we want to get together socially, meet new people and have fun – it isn’t all just about fundraising!

## PTFA Meetings

We hold regular meetings throughout the year – details will be sent out by the school office via ParentMail and email.

We will be holding our AGM at the start of the school year which provides an opportunity for you to hear about the work we do, the activities we have run, the funds we have raised and how the money has been spent in the previous school year.

It is also where we elect the new committee for the forthcoming year.

All meetings are open and any member can come along to find out what the PTFA is planning, share ideas and get involved – we would love to see you!

## How we raise money
The majority of funds are raised through events and activities we run throughout the year, as well as some ongoing fundraisers.  We also arrange events such as race nights, quiz nights etc. so look out for news!

*Donations from you, whether that be your time, money, cakes, raffle prizes etc. are critical in making these activities and events a success – we couldn’t do it without your help!*

## Support from Parentkind

Our PTA is a member of Parentkind, a membership organisation providing support and guidance to over 13,500 PTA’s.

Being a member provides us with advice and support ensuring we run our PTA well according to good practice guidance, and our activities are properly insured, legal and safe.

Parentkind also provides resources to parents – practical guidance on supporting your child(ren) throughout their school years. You can access a wealth of information on their website, or interesting chats and information on their Facebook page.
