# About Cruse

Cruse Bereavement Care was founded in 1959 in Richmond upon Thames and is the leading national charity for bereaved people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

*Our vision* is that all bereaved people have somewhere to turn when someone dies.
*Our mission is to offer support, advice and information to children, young people and adults when someone dies and  to enhance societyâ€™s care of bereaved people.
*Our values*: At Cruse Bereavement Care we are Responsive, Compassionate, Respectful, Supportive and Innovative.

Cruse offers face-to-face, telephone, email and website support. We have a Freephone national helpline and local services, and a website (hopeagain.org.uk) specifically for children and young people. Our services are provided by our network of 5,000 trained volunteers and are confidential and free. Cruse also provides training and consultancy for external organisations and for those who may encounter bereaved people in the course of their work.
